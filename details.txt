SPECIAL USER STATUS

-- We need a new table for this as a single user can have multiple achivements.
	- Table name - Achivements
		
		columns (user_id, achivementClass, achivementName)
		
		- achivementClass -> Which class does this achivement belongs to eg (creator, participant etc.)
		- achivementName -> ['event organizer', 'event master'... ] Name of the achivement accomplished / will be accomplished if in progress.
		- status -> Enum (progress | achived | maxed)
		- progressCount -> Number of times this was completed.
		
		We will store the key value pair of achivement class and there names. 

		[
			creator : {
				5 : 'event organizer'
				10 : 'event master'
			}
			...
		]

		And while updating the achivements table for a particular user we can refrence this table if there is nothing in progressCount + 1
		then the user has already maxed out this achivement.
		we are keeping status as progress till the user unlocks any one of the achivement names and then we will change it to achived.
		Same if user has maxed out their achivement we can change it to maxed so we will not query this again and agin.


COUPONS 

-- We need a new table.
	- Table name - Coupons

		Columns ( code, discount, discountType, uses, limit, expiresAt)
		
		- code -> coupon code (can be used to get a discount on purusit creation or for other websites)
		- discount -> inteager value 
		- discountType -> Enum (fixed | percentage)
		- uses -> number of times this coupon can be used.
		- limit -> maximum amount that can be discounted from this coupon.
		- expiresAt -> When the coupon will expire.


PURSUIT CUSTOM REWARDS

-- We need a new table.
	- Table name - PurusitRewards
		
		Columns ( pursuit_id, reward_title, reward_description, reward_image_url, reward_metadata, rank )
		
		- reward_title -> title of the reward like "Iphone14" etc. (incase of money it will be directly mentioned here 1000 etc.)
		- reward_description -> Short description of the reward like specifications etc.
		- reward_metadata -> Detailed specifications and terms&condition.
		- rank -> for which rank this reward is applicable.


-- 2nd suggestion

	- Create a new column reward_details in pursuit_list as JSON.
	
	it will be a object containg details similar to above.
	{
		rank (1) : {
			reward_title : string;
			reward_description: string;
			reward_image_url : string;
			reward_description: string;
			reward_metadata: JSON.
		},
		rank (2) : {
			reward_title : string;
			reward_description: string;
			reward_image_url : string;
			reward_description: string;
			reward_metadata: JSON.
		},
		...
	}
